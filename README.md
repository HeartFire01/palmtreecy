# palmtreecy8
This program can detect and count palm tree using YOLOv8 model and custom dataset

For YOLOv8 installation, type this command : 
`pip install ultralytics`

## Links to YOLOv8 Documentations

Link to the sample section: [https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/](#sample-section).


## Prerequisite

Install library from requirements.txt with command : `pip install -r requirements.txt `

## Step to use this :

1. You must have YOLOv8 model first like yolov8n.pt etc
2. Preparing the dataset
3. Training the model using dataset in Train.pynb
4. Use the pre-trained model and declare the path of the model was saved in PalmTreeCounter.ipynb to detect and count the image of palm tree taken and saved in aerial view mode
