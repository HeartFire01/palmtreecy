# palmtreecy8
This program can detect and count using YOLOv8 model and custom dataset

For YOLOv8 installation, type this command : 
`pip install ultralytics`

## Links to YOLOv8 Documentations

Link to the sample section: [https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/](#sample-section).

For requirements, type this command :
`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

The program was run in AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS, RTX 4060 Laptop

## Step to use this :

1. You must have YOLOv8 model first like yolov8n.pt etc
2. Preparing the dataset
3. Training the model using dataset in Train.pynb
4. Use the pre-trained model and declare the path of the model was saved in PalmTreeCounter.ipynb to detect and count the image of palm tree taken and saved in aerial view mode
